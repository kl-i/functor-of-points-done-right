\begin{dfn}[Fundamental vector fields A.K.A. infinitesimal action]
  
Let $G$ be an algebraic group over $k$ acting on
a $k$-space $X$.
Let $\f{g}$ denote the Lie algebra of $G$.
Then given $\de \in \f{g} = G(k[\ep])$,
we obtain a global vector field $X_\de$ on $X$ by
\[
  k[\ep] \times_k X \overset{(\de , \mathrm{id})}{\rightarrow} 
  G \times X \overset{\mathrm{act}}{\rightarrow} X
\]
$X_\de$ is called the \emph{fundamental vector field associated to $\de$}.

We obtain a morphism of Lie algebras 
\[
  \f{g} \to \Ga(X , T_X)
\]

In fact, for any affine open $U \subs X$, 
due to smoothness of $U$ we have that fundamental vector fields on $U$
must land inside $U$ : 
\begin{cd}
  U & U \\
	{k[\epsilon] \times_k U} & X
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["\id", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[dashed, from=2-1, to=1-2]
\end{cd}
So we get for every affine open $U$,
\[
  \f{g} \to \Ga(U , T_X)
\]
