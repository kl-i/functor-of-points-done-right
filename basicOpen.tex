From the perspective of topology,
the obvious thing to consider after closed embeddings
is the notion of an \emph{open embedding}.
This turns out to be quite subtle and
will in fact lead us directly to schemes.
For now, we introduce the more restrictive notion
of a \emph{basic open}.
The idea is again simple : 
given an element $f \in A$ of a $k$-algebra,
we want to consider the ``locus of $\SPEC A$ where $f$ is \emph{invertible}''.

\begin{dfn}
  
  Let $X \in \AFF_k$ and $f \in \cO(X)$.
  Define the \emph{basic open associated to $f$}
  as \[
    D(f) := \SPEC \cO(X)[1 / f]
  \] where
  $\cO(X)[1 / f] := \cO(X)[x] / (x f - 1)$
  the $\cO(X)$-algebra obtained by freely adjoining an inverse to $f$.
  The $k$-algebra map $\cO(X) \to \cO(X)[1 / f]$ defines
  a morphism \[
    j :  D(f) \to X
  \]
  We refer to $j$ as \emph{the inclusion of a basic open}.

  More generally,
  a basic open embedding of $X$ is 
  a morphism $j : U \to X$ in $\AFF_k$ 
  isomorphic to the inclusion of a basic open.
\end{dfn}

\begin{eg}
  The quintessential example of a basic open embedding
  is the morphism \[
    \bA^1_k \setminus \set{0} := D(t) \to \bA^1_k  
  \]
  where $D(t) = \SPEC k[t , t^{-1}]$ and the
  above morphism corresponds to the
  $k$-algebra map $k[t] \to k[t , t^{-1}]$.
  We will see later that in a precise sense
  this is the \emph{universal basic open embedding}.
  Note that we have also introduced
  suggestive notation of $D(t)$ as
  $\bA^1_k \setminus\set{0}$.
  We will be able to explain this
  in the next section after introducing \emph{fiber products}.
\end{eg}

\begin{prop}[Universal property of basic opens]
  
  Let $X \in \AFF_k$ and $f \in \cO(X)$.
  Let $j : D(f) \to X$ denote the associated basic open embedding.
  Then for all $s : T \to X$ in $\AFF_k$,
  we have a factoring \begin{cd}
    T & D(f) \\
    & X
    \arrow[from = 1-1 , to = 1-2 , dashed]
    \arrow[from = 1-1 , to = 2-2 , "{s}"']
    \arrow[from = 1-2 , to = 2-2, "{j}"]
  \end{cd}
  iff under the $k$-algebra map $s^* : \cO(X) \to \cO(T)$,
  the element $f$ becomes invertible.
  Furthermore, such a factoring is unique when it exists.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  This is just a restatement of
  the universal property of the $\cO(X)$-algebra map 
  $\cO(X) \to \cO(X)[1 / f]$.
\end{proof}

Again, the uniqueness part of the universal property
of basic opens says that $j : D(f) \to X$ is a monomorphism in $\AFF_k$
so it makes sense to think about $j$ as
the isomorphism onto a subspace of $X$.
